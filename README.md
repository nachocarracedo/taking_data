# taking_data

Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics

Summary (extract from Kaggle):

In this competition, you are going to predict the demographics of a user (gender and age) based on their app download and usage behaviors. 

The Data is collected from TalkingData SDK integrated within mobile apps TalkingData serves under the service term between TalkingData and mobile app developers. Full recognition and consent from individual user of those apps have been obtained, and appropriate anonymization have been performed to protect privacy. Due to confidentiality, we won't provide details on how the gender and age data was obtained. Please treat them as accurate ground truth for prediction. 

There are 2 python 3 notebooks:

EDA_Taking_Data : Explores the data
ML_Taking_Data : Tranforms the data and applies ML Models to classify devices.

I work with sparce matrix on this project which was something new for me at the time.
